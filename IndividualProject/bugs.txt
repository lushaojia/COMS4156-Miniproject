# Course.java

## Bugs identified by static analyzer:
* MissingOverride: The method 'toString()' is missing an @Override annotation.
## Bugs identified manually:
* The Course() constructor  initializes enrolledStudentCount to a wrong value. Should be 0 but found
500.
* The method enrollStudent() returns false regardless of whether the student is successfully
enrolled. Should check whether the course is already at capacity before trying to enroll a student.
* The method dropStudent() returns false regardless of whether a student is successfully dropped.
Should check whether the number of enrolled students is greater than 0 before dropping a student.
* The method getCourseLocation() returns instructor name instead of course location.
* The method getInstructorName() returns course location instead of instructor name.
