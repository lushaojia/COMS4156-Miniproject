# Course.java

## Bugs identified by static analyzer:
* MissingOverride: The method 'toString()' is missing an @Override annotation.
## Bugs identified manually:
* The Course() constructor  initializes enrolledStudentCount to a wrong value. Should be 0 but found
500.
* The method enrollStudent() returns false regardless of whether the student is successfully
enrolled. Should check whether the course is already at capacity before trying to enroll a student.
* The method dropStudent() returns false regardless of whether a student is successfully dropped.
Should check whether the number of enrolled students is greater than 0 before dropping a student.
* The method getCourseLocation() returns instructor name instead of course location.
* The method getInstructorName() returns course location instead of instructor name.
* The method isCourseFull() returns true when the course is not full and false when it is full.


# Department.java

## Bugs identified by static analyzer:
* UnusedPrivateField: Avoid unused private fields such as 'departmentChair'. The method
getDepartmentChair() returns "this.departmentChair" as a string instead of the actual department
chair.
## Bugs identified manually:
* The method getNumberOfMajors() returns the negative of this.numberOfMajors.
* The method dropPersonFromMajor() decreases the number of majors in the department by one even if
there are no majors in the department.
* The method toString() returns "result.toString()" instead of the actual result.
